Hello, I'm **Ioannis Vlachos**. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science under the guidance of **[George Christodoulou](https://sites.google.com/view/gchristo)** at **[Archimedes/RC Athena](https://archimedesai.gr/en/)** and **[Alkmini Sgouritsa](https://sites.google.com/site/alkminisgouritsa)** at the **[Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en)**. My research interests lie primarily in Mechanism Design and Learning-Augmented Algorithms.

Previously, I focused on computer vision and deep neural networks as a member of the **[AILS](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/)** lab, supervised by **[Stefanos Kollias](http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/lab/stefanos/)**. I have also worked as an R&D Engineer at **[Inos Hellas](https://www.inos-automation.de/en/)**, where I contributed to computer vision projects and innovative solutions for the automotive industry.
